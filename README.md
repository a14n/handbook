# Handbook

Shorebird company handbook.

The Shorebird handbook is the central repository of how we run the company.  It
is a living document that is updated as we learn and grow.  We welcome your
feedback and contributions.

The doc got big, so I split it into sections:

# Sections
* [Company](company.md)
* [Engineering](engineering.md)
* [Onboarding](onboarding.md)
* [CEO](ceo.md)


# Contributing

There are many things missing from this handbook; contributions are welcome.  If
you're looking for inspiration, there is good prior art:
